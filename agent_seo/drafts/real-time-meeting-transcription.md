# Real-time meeting transcription: how it works and which tools do it locally

Published: June 25, 2026 · Updated: June 25, 2026 · By Samal Bekmaganbetova · 12 min read

![A professional reviewing a live meeting transcript on a laptop screen during a video call](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587825140708-dfaf72ae4b04?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=80)

**TL;DR**

- Real-time meeting transcription converts spoken words to text as the meeting happens, not after it ends.
- Three main approaches exist: built-in platform tools (Zoom, Teams), cloud AI bots (Otter.ai, Fireflies), and local on-device processing (Siplinx AI).
- 73% of businesses cite privacy as the primary reason they haven't adopted meeting transcription tools (Sonix, 2025).
- Cloud-based tools upload your audio to third-party servers. If your meetings contain confidential information, that matters a lot.
- Local transcription processes everything on your device. No audio leaves your computer.

**Real-time meeting transcription** is a technology that converts spoken words to text during a meeting, giving participants a live readable record of everything said. Unlike post-meeting transcription (which processes a recorded file afterward), real-time systems work with a continuous audio stream and produce text within one to three seconds of each utterance.

## What is real-time meeting transcription and how does it actually work? {#what-is-real-time-meeting-transcription}

Real-time meeting transcription captures audio from a live meeting and produces a text transcript within seconds, before the meeting ends. The system listens to your microphone or system audio, runs it through a speech-to-text engine, identifies who is speaking, and displays or saves the resulting text continuously.

The technical pipeline behind this has three stages. First, audio capture: the software taps into your microphone input or system audio output, usually in small chunks of 100 to 500 milliseconds. Second, acoustic processing: the audio chunk goes through a speech recognition model, which maps audio frequencies to phonemes, then words. Third, speaker diarization: the system assigns each text segment to a speaker, using voice prints or color-coded labels.

The speed of this matters. A real-time system can produce a word-for-word record of a 60-minute meeting while the meeting is still happening. A post-meeting system might take 5 to 15 minutes after the call ends to produce the same output. For meetings where you need to act on decisions immediately, or where you want to search for something that was said while the conversation is still going, real-time output changes how useful the transcript actually is.

Most modern tools use variants of OpenAI's Whisper model, or proprietary neural networks trained on tens of thousands of hours of audio. Word error rates below 2% are now standard on clear audio, according to benchmark comparisons published in 2026.

## What are the three main approaches to real-time transcription? {#three-approaches}

The three approaches are platform-native tools, cloud AI bots, and local on-device processing. They differ in where your audio goes, how accurate the output is, and what you need to do to set them up.

**Platform-native tools** are built directly into Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet. Teams has had live transcription since 2021. Zoom's AI Companion added real-time transcription in 2023. Google Meet's live captions have been available since 2019. These tools are convenient because they're already where you meet, but they're limited in one important way: they only work inside those platforms. If your call is on a different tool, or if you're recording an in-person meeting, native platform tools don't help. They also typically send your audio through the platform's cloud infrastructure, which means Microsoft, Google, or Zoom is processing your conversation.

**Cloud AI bots** are standalone tools like Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Tactiq, and Read AI. They join your meeting as a participant (or as a browser extension), capture the audio, send it to their own servers for processing, and return a transcript. These tools often add features like summary generation, action item extraction, and CRM integration. The tradeoff: every word spoken in your meeting is uploaded to a third-party server. And in 2025, that risk became concrete.

**Local on-device processing** is the third approach. Tools like [Siplinx AI](https://siplinx.com/?utm_source=own_blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=real-time-meeting-transcription&utm_content=intro-local-processing) process audio entirely on your computer using a local speech-to-text model. No audio is sent to any server. The transcript never leaves your device. This approach requires more processing power (particularly a capable CPU or GPU), but modern Apple Silicon and recent Windows machines handle it without noticeable strain.

## Why do 73% of businesses hold back on AI meeting transcription? {#privacy-barrier}

According to Sonix's 2025 research, 73% of businesses identify privacy concerns as the primary reason they haven't adopted AI meeting transcription tools. That number surprised me when I first read it, because the productivity case for transcription is so strong. But once I started digging into what "privacy concerns" actually means, the hesitation made complete sense.

The most direct example came in August 2025. NPR reported that Otter.ai faced a class-action lawsuit, consolidated in U.S. District Court on October 22, 2025, over allegations that the tool recorded private conversations without obtaining consent from all participants. Many Otter users set the tool to join meetings automatically when connected to a calendar. The meeting host had given consent. But the other participants? No one asked them.

That's not a hypothetical risk. It's a named lawsuit with a specific court date.

Beyond consent issues, there's the question of where your data goes after it's transcribed. Cloud transcription services store audio and transcripts on their servers. Most offer data retention settings, but the default is often to keep transcripts indefinitely. If your company handles patient records, legal advice, financial projections, or any confidential client information, every meeting you transcribe through a cloud tool creates a data exposure point.

The Verizon 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report found that third-party involvement in breaches doubled from 15% to 30% in a single year. Every cloud meeting tool you add is another vendor link in that chain. Lawyers operating under attorney-client privilege, doctors subject to HIPAA, and consultants handling non-disclosure agreements face real consequences if transcripts of sensitive conversations are exposed.

So the hesitation isn't paranoia. It's a rational response to documented risk.

## How accurate is real-time meeting transcription in 2026? {#accuracy}

Real-time AI transcription accuracy has reached a level where it's genuinely useful for professional documentation. Leading systems now achieve word error rates below 2% on clear audio in English, according to benchmark data published in 2026. Krisp reports 96% accuracy across its platform. Whisper-based local models hit 90% to 95% on clear speech, with the larger model variants performing at the high end.

But accuracy in practice depends on several variables. The most important is audio quality. A meeting with one speaker, no background noise, and a decent microphone will produce near-perfect output. Add four people talking in a conference room with a ceiling speaker, and accuracy drops noticeably for everyone except the person closest to the microphone.

Speaker diarization, the system's ability to identify who is speaking, is the second variable. Most tools handle two-to-three speakers reliably. Beyond that, especially when voices have similar pitch or people interrupt each other, misattribution creeps in. I've seen transcripts where two participants were merged into one speaker label for an entire section of conversation, which makes review much harder.

Accents and technical vocabulary are the third factor. Standard American and British English accuracy is highest. Accented speech, industry jargon, and proper nouns (client names, product names, medical terminology) are where most tools show their limits. Some tools let you add a custom vocabulary list to improve recognition on specialized terms. Others don't.

The practical takeaway: for meeting documentation in a standard office setting with clear audio, real-time transcription in 2026 is accurate enough to use as a primary record. You'll still want to skim the transcript for obvious errors, but the time savings versus manual note-taking are substantial. Research from Sonix found that 62% of professionals recover more than four hours per week through automated transcription.

## How does local transcription compare to cloud-based tools? {#local-vs-cloud}

The core difference is where processing happens. Cloud tools send your audio to a remote server, run transcription there, and return text. Local tools run the speech model on your own machine and never transmit audio at all.

Here's a direct comparison:

| Feature                         | Cloud-based tools (Otter.ai, Fireflies) | Local tools (Siplinx AI)      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Audio leaves your device        | Yes (uploaded to vendor servers)        | No (processed on-device only) |
| Works offline                   | No                                      | Yes                           |
| HIPAA / GDPR friendly           | Depends on BAA / DPA agreements         | Yes by design                 |
| Setup complexity                | Low (browser extension or app)          | Low (desktop install)         |
| Accuracy on clear audio         | 95% to 99%                              | 90% to 95%                    |
| Speaker diarization             | Usually strong                          | Good (improving)              |
| Monthly cost                    | $10 to $40/user                         | One-time or flat subscription |
| Data retention risk             | Yes (vendor stores data)                | None                          |
| Works with any meeting platform | Yes                                     | Yes                           |

The accuracy gap between cloud and local tools has narrowed significantly. A year ago, cloud tools had a clear edge. Now, local models running Whisper large-v3 match cloud accuracy on standard English audio. For specialized vocabulary or non-English languages, cloud tools still have an advantage from larger training datasets.

The cost difference is also worth noting. Cloud transcription typically runs $10 to $40 per user per month. Automated transcription costs $0.10 to $0.30 per minute compared to $1.50 to $4.00 per minute for manual transcription (Sonix, 2025). Local tools often use a one-time or flat subscription model, which works out cheaper for regular users.

The decision usually comes down to one question: do you handle confidential information in meetings? If yes, local processing removes the data exposure risk entirely. If your meetings are general business discussions with no sensitive content, cloud tools offer more features and broader language support.

## How do you get real-time transcription without a bot joining your call? {#no-bot}

Many professionals have a specific constraint: their organization doesn't allow third-party bots in meetings. Some enterprise security policies block external participants. Some clients object to having an AI attendee in the room. And some meetings involve privileged information that shouldn't be captured by a visible participant.

You have three options that produce real-time transcription without a bot joining:

**1. Use your platform's native transcription.** Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet all offer built-in transcription that runs inside the platform itself, no external participant required. Teams transcription is available to Microsoft 365 subscribers. In Teams, go to More > Start transcription during a meeting. The transcript appears live for all participants. Zoom's AI Companion (available on paid plans) works similarly. The limitation: this only works for meetings on that specific platform.

**2. Use a browser extension without a bot.** Tactiq operates as a Chrome extension and captures the audio from your meeting tab without joining as a visible participant. It's technically still sending audio to Tactiq's servers, but no bot account shows up in the participant list. Other users won't see an AI attendee.

**3. Use desktop audio capture with local processing.** This is the most private option. Tools like [Siplinx AI](https://siplinx.com/download/?utm_source=own_blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=real-time-meeting-transcription&utm_content=no-bot-local) capture system audio (what comes through your speakers or headphones) without joining the meeting at all. They run transcription locally and produce a real-time transcript on your screen. No bot joins. No audio leaves your device. This works with any meeting platform, including in-person conversations recorded through a microphone.

**How to set up local real-time transcription in 5 steps:**

1. Download and install a local transcription tool (Siplinx AI is available for Mac and Windows).
2. Grant it access to your system audio or microphone in your OS settings (System Preferences > Privacy > Microphone on Mac; Settings > Privacy > Microphone on Windows).
3. Open the tool before your meeting starts.
4. Select your audio source: system audio for remote meetings, microphone for in-person.
5. Start transcription. The tool captures audio from that point forward and displays the transcript in real time on your screen.

That's the full setup. No calendar integration required. No bot to configure. No third-party account to create for the meeting platform.

## Which transcription approach is right for your use case? {#right-approach}

The right tool depends on three factors: your privacy requirements, your meeting platforms, and how you use the transcript afterward.

If you handle confidential information, local processing is the right choice. Lawyers, doctors, therapists, financial advisors, and executives discussing M&A or litigation should not be sending audio to third-party servers, regardless of the vendor's privacy policy. The Otter.ai lawsuit is a reminder that even tools with reasonable policies can end up in legal trouble over consent and data practices. [See how Siplinx AI compares to cloud alternatives](https://siplinx.com/compare/?utm_source=own_blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=real-time-meeting-transcription&utm_content=comparison-cta) on the features that matter for privacy-sensitive work.

If your meetings are internal business discussions with no confidential content, cloud tools offer practical advantages: better language support, CRM integration, shared transcripts, and collaborative editing. Otter.ai, Fireflies, and Tactiq all work well for this use case.

If you primarily use one platform (Teams or Zoom), the built-in transcription is the easiest option. You don't need another tool, and the transcript lives inside your meeting record automatically.

If you need transcription to work offline (travel, client sites without internet, air-gapped environments), local processing is the only viable option.

For multilingual meetings or non-English audio, cloud tools currently have stronger language models. Whisper supports 57 languages, but cloud services trained on larger, more diverse datasets tend to perform better on non-English speech, particularly with accents.

Honestly, the tool that made the most sense to me for professional use is local processing. Not because cloud tools are bad, but because the privacy question is real and the local accuracy is now close enough that the tradeoff is worth it for anyone handling sensitive conversations. The days when local speech recognition was clearly inferior to cloud are over.

## Key takeaways

- Real-time transcription produces text during a meeting, not after. The difference matters for immediate action items and live reference.
- Three approaches: platform-native (Teams, Zoom), cloud AI bots (Otter.ai, Fireflies), and local on-device (Siplinx AI). Each has different privacy implications.
- 73% of businesses cite privacy as their primary barrier to adoption. The risk is real: cloud tools upload your audio to vendor servers, and data breach exposure has increased.
- Accuracy on clear English audio now exceeds 95% across leading tools. The gap between cloud and local is narrow.
- You can get real-time transcription without any bot joining your meeting, using platform-native tools, browser extensions, or local desktop apps.

## FAQ {#faq}

**What is the best real-time meeting transcription tool in 2026?**
The best tool depends on your needs. For general business use without strict privacy requirements, Otter.ai and Fireflies offer strong accuracy and integrations. For privacy-sensitive work, local tools like Siplinx AI process everything on-device with no audio uploaded to external servers. For users who live inside Microsoft Teams or Zoom, the built-in transcription is the simplest option.

**Is there a free real-time meeting transcription app?**
Yes. Otter.ai has a free tier with limited monthly minutes. Google Meet's live captions are free for Google Workspace users. Microsoft Teams transcription requires a Microsoft 365 subscription. Most free tiers restrict usage: typically 300 to 600 minutes per month. Local tools may have a free trial period.

**How accurate is AI meeting transcription?**
Leading tools achieve 95% to 99% accuracy on clear English audio in 2026. Accuracy drops for heavy accents, multiple overlapping speakers, technical jargon, and low-quality microphones. Speaker diarization (identifying who said what) is reliable for two to three speakers and less reliable beyond that.

**Can I transcribe meetings without a bot joining the call?**
Yes. Platform-native tools (Teams, Zoom, Google Meet) transcribe without an external participant. Browser extensions like Tactiq don't appear as participants. Local desktop tools like Siplinx AI capture system audio without joining the meeting at all. Your other participants won't see an AI attendee.

**Is real-time meeting transcription HIPAA compliant?**
It can be, but it depends on the tool and how it's configured. Cloud tools require a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the vendor to be HIPAA compliant, and not all vendors offer this. Local tools that process everything on-device and never transmit audio are HIPAA friendly by design, because patient audio never leaves your device.

**What is the difference between real-time and post-meeting transcription?**
Real-time transcription produces text during the meeting, within seconds of each utterance. Post-meeting transcription processes a recording after the meeting ends, usually taking 5 to 15 minutes for a one-hour meeting. Real-time output lets you reference the transcript while the conversation is happening. Post-meeting transcription is often slightly more accurate because it can process the full audio context at once.

**Does real-time transcription work offline?**
Cloud-based tools require an internet connection to upload audio and return text. Local processing tools like Siplinx AI work fully offline because the speech model runs on your device. If you need transcription in locations without reliable internet, or in environments with strict data egress policies, local is the only viable option.

---

## Conclusion

Real-time meeting transcription is no longer a niche feature. It's become a standard professional tool, and the technology is accurate enough to rely on for most business documentation. But how the tool handles your audio matters as much as how accurate it is.

Cloud tools are fast to set up and offer strong integrations, but they send your audio to servers you don't control. For confidential meetings, that's a problem that can't be patched with a privacy policy. Local processing solves it by design: audio stays on your device, the transcript stays on your device, and nothing goes anywhere.

If you handle sensitive conversations in your work, the decision isn't complicated. Try a local transcription tool and see whether the accuracy meets your needs. For most professional use cases in 2026, it does.
